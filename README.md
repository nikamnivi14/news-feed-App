# Assignment

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.0.

# Project Details
This App is created to display the list of Top Stories and Latest Stories, having the link which will open the url into new tab.

1. For this I have created a new component i.e news-list.component to display the List of stories and the pagination.
2. In app.component I have added search funcationality to search the stories, and also toggle between Top stories and New stories.
3. To Interact with the .net Core API to get the data from Hacker News API, I have created a http service which we call the api and return the stories.
